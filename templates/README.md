SisComando Templates
====================

This is templates that will build the templates in app. It's not the definitive artfacts.
Because is necessary "vulcanize" the build.html to app/templates/app.html.

Sample
======
```
vulcanize -o ../../../src/templates/app.html build.html
# where build.html is the prebuilt code and app.html is production pack.
```
