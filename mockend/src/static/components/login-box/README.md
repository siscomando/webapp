login-box
================

See the [component page](http://adracus.github.io/login-box) for more information.

## Getting Started

Download the element using bower. For that, enter

    bower install --save login-box

And the element will be installed and persisted in your bower.json.


## Using the element
Usage is very simple. Just type

```html
<login-box></login-box>
```

and you're good to go!

The element only fires its `login-box-login-try` event, if both
the identification value and password value are filled. In the event detail,
there is a field `idValue` and a field `pwValue`, both should be quite self-
explanatory.
